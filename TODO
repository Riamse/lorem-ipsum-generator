* Optionally produce markup, e.g. paragraphs, etc. (DONE)
* Provide "filters" for output markup, e.g. to produce OO.o markup, Markdown, BBcode, etc. (NOW POSSIBLE, BUT WON'T DO)

* Make generator class more general-purpose, open up some of its options, etc.
* Analyse HTML pages and produce Lipsum text which mimicks formatting as well as words - e.g. headings, lists, etc.
* Make GUI optional -- i.e. make lorem-ipsum-generator useable from CLI
* Make it possible to cancel generation of text mid-way -- e.g. generating 999 paragraphs of text can take a while, it would be nice if I could cancel it if I accidentally selected 999
* Tooltips
* Speed up text buffer on generating large amounts -- i.e. the text only gradually appears, and isn't completely there until a few seconds after it has started appearing on the screen
